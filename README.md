How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable it is important to take your time and add lots of comments while creating code. When you add comments it helps other developers understand your thought process and the blueprint of the code. While working on the CRUD Python module there were multiple advantages of this assignment. The purpose of CRUD in MongoDB is based off the fundamental operations of read, update, and delete (CRUD). Creating databases of document collections (AAC) and performing operations to retrieve specific documents from the database system. Using the mongo import tool I was able to create method that retrieved the needed documentation for this project. The class that is created has the purpose of 

•	Input arguments to function a set of key/value pairs in the data type to the MongoDB API call
•	Read methods that queries for documents from a specified MongoDB database and collection
•	Update methods that change documents from the specified MongoDB database
•	Delete methods that removes, and updates specified documents from MongoDB database





How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first step to approaching a problem as a computer scientist is to be patient, inquisitive, and pay attention to detail. Many times errors can be small and can have a big affect on the softwares reliability. I like to run the program every couple of lines of code because it makes it easier to control errors and makes them fixable before it turns major. Minor errors can turn into major issues quick if they pile up and they are not acknowledged quickly. The techniques I use to meet client needs is to go over their requirement documents in detail. I like to sit down and have a meeting with them in person or on zoom if they are long distance and make sure that we are all on the same page with the design process of the software. 




What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
